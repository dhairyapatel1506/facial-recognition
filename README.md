# Features
- Can recgonize faces through images, in real-time through a webcam and through recorded video.

<!--# Requirements & Setup
- First, refer <a href="https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/#installation">this</a> for the requirements and to install all the basic dependencies.
- Then, install ffmpeg (Video Recognition won't work without this) and you should be good to go:
   - ```sudo apt install ffmpeg```

I've included 4 sample files with the project—3 images and 1 video, all labelled _unknown_. You can use these to test the program.

_Image Database_ is the folder that stores the images of the people you want the system to recognize. I've also included 2 sample images in here, of Biden and Obama. You can add your own images to this folder and save them with the name that you want the system to identify that person with.

Run: ```python main.py```

# ToDo
  <p>☐ Implement multi-threading/multi-processing to increase video processing speeds.</p>
  <p>☐ Implement feature to add new images through the user interface.</p>
  <p>☐ Display the time taken in completing a functionality.</p>
